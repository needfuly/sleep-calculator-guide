# Sleep Calculator Guide

Many people sleep for 7–8 hours but still wake up feeling tired. The problem is often not sleep duration, but sleep timing.

## How Sleep Cycles Work
Sleep happens in cycles of approximately 90 minutes. Each cycle includes light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. Waking up in the middle of a cycle can cause grogginess and fatigue.

## Why Timing Matters More Than Hours
Sleeping longer does not always mean better rest. Aligning your sleep and wake time with natural sleep cycles can significantly improve energy and focus.

## Using a Sleep Calculator
A sleep calculator helps estimate the best times to go to bed or wake up based on sleep cycles rather than guessing.
