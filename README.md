# How Sleep Cycles Affect Wake-Up time

Many people sleep for 7–8 hours but still wake up feeling tired. The problem is often not sleep duration, but sleep timing.

## How Sleep Cycles Work
Sleep happens in cycles of approximately 90 minutes. Each cycle includes light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. Waking up in the middle of a cycle can cause grogginess and fatigue.

## Why Timing Matters More Than Hours
Sleeping longer does not always mean better rest. Aligning your sleep and wake time with natural sleep cycles can significantly improve energy and focus.

## Using a Sleep Calculator
Instead of guessing, a sleep calculator helps you find the best times to sleep or wake based on sleep cycles.
I personally explored a simple guide that explains sleep cycles clearly and links to a practical calculator you can use immediately.
